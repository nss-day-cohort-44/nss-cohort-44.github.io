Nashville Software School is much more than just a school. It's an amazing, supportive community that embraces each student with the strength and care of a mother determined to see her children succeed.\n                    We know you run a tight ship as a non-profit, yet you and your team still manage to carefully craft each detail of our experience and prepare us more than we could have ever imagined.</div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"thanks-section\">\n                    <span className=\"thanks-titles\"> To the NSS Team, <br />\n                    Amy, Laura, Mandy, and Jeremiah <br /></span>\n                    <div className=\"thanks-message\">\n                    Thank you for making every day and event run smoothly.

The curriculum could get intense and fast-paced at times, but your humor and dedication to making sure each student had a certain level of understanding made the learning process so enjoyable (and funny, at times!).

Thank you for using your superhero magic to turn us into the best, graduate-ready packages we can be.

We went out after class and karaoke'd to celebrate little wins. We are always here for each other, even in our post-NSS careers, and that makes it so much better.</div>\n                </div>\n                </p> */}\n\n        </section>\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default Thanks;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
